# PD Action Plan

## Step I: Research Job Market

* Research and collect job postings with search terms like HTML, CSS and jQuery -- these job titles will most likely be more along the lines of "Web Developer", "Web Assistant", "Front-End Developer" as opposed to "Software Engineer"

## Step II: Resumes, Cover Letters and Portfolio Site
* Make sure you have a solid resume and cover letter template that you can tailor to different job postings
  * Both documents should be modified for each job application -- what technical skills and professional skills do they seem to care about most in their job posting? What does their company website say about their culture/mission/etc.? Work all of this research into your documents
  * [Cover Letter Checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md) | [Cover Letter Workshop](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_workshop.md)
* If you don't already have one, create a portfolio site
  * You can deploy this directly to github pages, include a link to this site on your resume
  * No need for it to be terribly fancy or complex, a simple HTML/CSS/jQuery website will do
  * Should include: a description about yourself, your resume, contact information, descriptions and links to your completed projects, and any blog posts that you might write in the meantime
  
## Step III: Fix Up Projects, Begin Applying to Positions
* Determine which projects are best for you to showcase your skills and prioritize:
  * Reviewing your code and filing issues on things that need to be fixed
  * Reflecting on each project -- **write out answers to each of the following questions** Your responses should be as specific as possible, you will use these reflections as your anecdotes during interviews that allow you to demonstrate your passion, growth, and technical knowledge:
    * What was the most rewarding part of the project?
    * What was the most challenging thing? The toughest bug to solve?
    * What was the collaboration process like (what went well/what went poorly/what did you learn from it?)
  * Dedicate some time each day to fixing one of the issues you've filed to improve your project to slowly get them into a better state, and continue coding
* Begin applying to job postings! -- Don't wait until your projects are in perfect shape, they'll never be in perfect shape and you'll never end up applying to anything if you wait for everything to be flawless.

## Step IV: Interview Prep & Portfolio Work
* As you start applying to job postings, begin prepping yourself for the interview process
  * Keep up with CodeWars challenges (I'd recommend 1-2 per day as a warmup)
  * Review lesson plans from Mod 1 & 2, and write short (2-3 paragaph) blog posts that demonstrate your technical knowledge on the different concepts you've learned throughout Turing. Add these blog posts to your portfolio site so you can "pre-prove" yourself to potential employers before you even get to the interview
  * Write out answers to these [behavioral interview questions](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/behavioral_interview_prep.md)
  * Think about good [questions to ask](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/research_conversation_questions.md) while you're on the interview, or doing a coffee/networking meeting
